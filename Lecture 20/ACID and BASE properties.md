### **ACID Properties** – For Banking Systems

**ACID** properties are used in traditional databases, especially where transactions must be reliable and accurate, like **banking systems**. ACID ensures that all database transactions are processed reliably.

1. **Atomicity**: All operations within a transaction are either completed or none are.  
   - Example: When transferring money from one bank account to another, both the debit and credit should happen together. If one fails, the entire transaction is rolled back (nothing happens).

2. **Consistency**: The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.  
   - Example: If you withdraw ₹1,000 from your account, the balance should always decrease by exactly ₹1,000. The total balance in all accounts should stay valid after the transaction.

3. **Isolation**: Each transaction is independent and does not interfere with others.  
   - Example: If two people are withdrawing from the same account at the same time, both transactions should reflect the correct balance, as if one happened before the other.

4. **Durability**: Once a transaction is completed, the data is permanently saved, even if the system crashes.  
   - Example: After a successful money transfer, the transaction record is saved permanently, and no data is lost in case of system failure.

**Summary for Banking Systems**:  
Banking systems need **ACID** properties because transactions must be 100% reliable. No one wants to lose money because of a system crash or inconsistency!

### **BASE Properties** – For Social Media Sites

**BASE** properties are used in **distributed systems** like social media platforms, where availability and speed are more important than strict accuracy (like ACID).

1. **Basically Available**: The system guarantees availability, meaning it responds to queries even if some data is missing or outdated.  
   - Example: On a social media site, you can still see posts and likes even if a server is down, but the most recent likes or comments may not be immediately visible.

2. **Soft State**: Data can change over time, even without new input (due to data replication).  
   - Example: You may see an old version of someone's profile, and after a few seconds, it updates to the latest one.

3. **Eventual Consistency**: The system will eventually become consistent after some time, even if it’s temporarily inconsistent.  
   - Example: If you update your profile picture, it might take a few seconds or minutes before all your friends see the updated picture, but eventually, everyone will see the same picture.

**Summary for Social Media**:  
Social media sites prioritize speed and availability over immediate consistency. It’s okay if data is slightly out of sync for a short time because it's more important that users can access the site without delays.
